        <p class="pa">LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. — The Orlando Magic used two buses to keep a 35-person traveling party well spread out on the 23-mile journey that made them the first team to enter the N.B.A.’s restricted campus environment on July 7.</p>
        <p class="pa">Though there were far more pressing concerns on such a momentous ride, Orlando’s Nikola Vucevic had another date circled on his internal calendar: July 10. That was the release date for the 2020 edition of the F1 video game.</p>
        <p class="pa">“I’m a big Formula One fan,” Vucevic said.</p>
        <p class="pa">So big, in fact, that Vucevic packed his preferred portable steering wheel for the short trip from the Magic’s arena, Amway Center, to the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa at Walt Disney World, which is hosting N.B.A. teams as the league reboots its suspended season. Vucevic was determined to be well-equipped for down time on an assignment that will last well into August — or longer if Orlando goes beyond the first round of the playoffs.</p>
        <p class="pa">Vucevic has also benefited from the one true perk of proximity: Magic players can ask family and friends to drop off items at an external hub that handles mail and delivery shipments for all teams.</p>
