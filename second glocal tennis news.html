    Zvirev, ranked seventh in the world, was a participant in the "Adria Tor" course organized by the first seeded Serbian Novak<br>
    Djokovic recently in the Balkan countries, and saw the recording of the injury of four players with "Covid 19", they are<br> 
    Jokovic and his countryman Viktor Troitsky, Bulgarian Grigor Dimitrov and Croatian Borna Choric.<br><br>
    The result of his examination was negative, Zverev pledged to commit to self-isolation, but he appeared in a video widely<br>
    circulated on the websites, and it is likely that he was filmed during the weekend, showing his celebration in a nightclub<br>
    in an unspecified location.<br><br>
    The German himself found himself the subject of criticism from users on social media,joined by the controversial Australian tennis<br>
    player Nick Kirius who was a critical critic of the establishment of "Adria" in light of the crisis "Covid 19", especially since the<br>
    session witnessed the presence of thousands of fans, and was not respected During which the players are rules of social spacing.<br><br>
    The Australian posted a video via his Twitter account, in which he said: "I woke up from sleep to see more controversial things<br>
    happening in the world.<br><br>
    Zverev asked, "To what extent can you be selfish? If you have the nerve to post a tweet that your team wrote on your behalf,<br>
    you say that you will isolate yourself for 14 days and apologize to the public for putting it in a health risk, the least you can<br>
     have the nerve to stay inside (the house) For 14 days. "<br><br>
