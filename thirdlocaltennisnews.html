MONROE, La. – Hala Badwy, who compiled a 15-8 singles record as a freshman at the University of North Texas, has signed a grant-in-aid to enroll at ULM in August.<br><br>
 
 A native of New Cairo, Egypt, Badwy posted an 8-4 singles mark in dual matches while playing the No. 2, 3 and 4 positions. Her eight dual-match singles wins ranked second on the team. She also went 7-5 while playing No. 1 doubles, including a 6-1 record against region opponents.<br><br>
  
 "I'm very excited to add Hala to our roster," first-year ULM head tennis coach Jessica Giuggioli said. "Her determination, experience and accomplishments really made her standout throughout the recruiting process, and I'm confident that she'll be a tremendous asset to our team."<br><br>

 The left-handed Badwy attained a career-best Junior ITF world ranking of 157 and became the No. 1-ranked player in Egypt for all age groups.<br><br><br>
  
 Badwy placed third in both singles and doubles at the U18 African Junior Championship in 2018. She was a finalist in singles and placed third in doubles at the U16 African Junior Championship in 2016. Badwy won both the singles and doubles at the African Youth Olympic Games and twice qualified for the Junior World Cup.<br><br><br>

 She becomes the third member of ULM's 2020 recruiting class, joining Drousile Dzeubou, a graduate transfer from Radford University, and incoming freshman Daniela Hernandez, from Caracas, Venezuela.<br><br>
