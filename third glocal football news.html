        <p class="one">Mikel Arteta has warned his Arsenal players that they have achieved nothing by beating Liverpool and Manchester City in the space of four days because success is earned over the course of a season.<br>
            The Gunners toppled the Premier League champions last Wednesday before following it up with victory over Pep Guardiola’s side to reach the FA Cup final at Wembley.<br>
            The 2-0 win over City, in particular, was hailed as an example of how Arteta has improved Arsenal since taking over in December.<br>
            But on Monday he said: ‘Obviously this is a marathon, this is a long-term thing that has to be played and you have to do it consistently for 10 months.<br>
            ‘It's not good enough to just do it for a week so we haven't done anything, just won two games that give us a big plus in the league and the sense that if we are all doing our best we can beat any team but now we have to be consistent and do it every three days.’<br>
            Arsenal’s opening goal against City on Saturday came after they built all the way from goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez inside his own area.<br>
            The Gunners flirted with danger before working the ball up the pitch for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to score.<br>
            When asked whether his side’s risky tactics made him nervous, Arteta said: ‘No. I get nervous when we kick the ball long. The quicker it goes there, the quicker it comes back. I'd rather do that with the right structure, the right timing and using the right spaces. It's something that we have to do more often.’<br>

            Despite recent results, Arsenal head into Tuesday night’s clash with Aston Villa sitting 10th in the table, knowing their faint hopes of European football will be decided over the next two games.<br>
            ‘I wanted to get to this point with options and clearly, we have options,’ said Arteta, whose side are five points off sixth-place Tottenham.<br>
            ‘It's not in our hands at the moment and we knew that was going to be difficult, but we need to give it a go and try to win both games and then wait and see what happens. If we do that, I think we will have a good chance.’<br>
            Defender Shkodran Mustafi will be assessed after he picked up a hamstring injury against City. Eddie Nketiah and Cedric are available again, however, after respective suspension and ineligibility.<br>

            Arteta also revealed he had not discussed a potential return to north London with Santi Cazorla later down the line, who is set to join Barcelona legend Xavi at Al Sadd in Qatar.<br>
            But Arteta said: 'About the coaching role and the future, we will see what happens. Right now, he's just finished (at Villarreal) so let him enjoy that moment and we'll see what happens in the future.'
