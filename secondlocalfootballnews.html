        <img src="images/aliou.jpg" width="100%" title="Aliou Dieng">
        <br> <br>
        <p class="article">Dieng signed for Al Ahly in July 2019 coming from Algerian side MC Algiers, after spending one season there.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">The 22-year-old made 21 appearances for the Reds across all competitions, scoring on two occasions and providing the same amount of assists.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">He also played an important role in helping them top the Egyptian Premier League table and reach the CAF Champions League semi-finals.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">Talking to Malian website, Bamada.net, Dieng spoke about his time in Egypt and how his manager, Rene Weiler, helped him settle in.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“I had signed a two-year contract with MC Algiers but stayed just one season. My agent entered negotiations with many clubs even in Europe. But sadly the only team that met MC Algiers’ requirements was Al Ahly. That’s why I came to Egypt on July 5th 2019 and signed for the Red Devils.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“Honestly, since signing, everything has been going well with the club officials and especially with the manager Rene Weiler who was very patient with me. We’re like a family at Al Ahly, even the club’s name means family in Arabic.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“Al Ahly is the most popular and most titled club in Egypt. Overall they won 88 local trophies and 20 continental trophies, including eight Champions League. I’m proud to play for this team,” he added.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">He then talked about the league’s return and how he prepared during the quarantine. He also discussed Zamalek’s decision to withdraw from the league.</p>
        <br>
                <img src="images/dieng.jpg" width="100%" title="Aliou Dieng"> <br>
        <p class="article">“Indeed the league will resume soon. We have already restarted training like all clubs in the country and the training sessions respect all sanitary guidelines. The Egyptian FA, led by Amr El-Ganainy are taking all the precautionary measures in all stadium by implementing all the sanitary materials,” he continued.</p> 
        <br>
        <p class="article">“Regarding Al Ahly, we’re ready and we’ll do whatever we can to lift the league title. We’re on top of the table with 49 points, while the second, Arab Contractors, and third, Pyramids FC, have 33 and 31 points respectively.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“I don’t know what will happen exactly, let’s wait and see the FA reaction. I’m just a player so I can’t say much on this topic. What’s important for me is the league’s resumption, which we’ve been waiting for. I hope that Zamalek change their decision as soon as possible.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“It was hard because I wasn’t used to staying at home. I was very bored, all I did was watch TV. Thankfully Rene Weiler gave us exercises to do at home which was a big relief for me. I had two training sessions, in the morning and at night, then I would talk to my friends on social media as well as my family.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“Now it’s okay, we started group trainings but it is mandatory to wear the mask which is very tiring but I have no choice.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article">“All Al Ahly players had to follow all instructions enforced by the medical authorities. Each player had his own training regimen which was sent on our Whatsapp group and Weiler monitored everything,” he explained.</p>
