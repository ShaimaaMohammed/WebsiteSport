                <p class="ti">Ginobili says Scola deserves to end Argentina career at Tokyo Olympics</p>
                <p class="pa"> BUENOS AIRES (Argentina) - Manu Ginobili believes Luis Scola should compete for Argentina again next summer at the Tokyo Olympics before drawing the curtain on his legendary national team career.

                    Scola, 40, is an enduring symbol of excellence and commitment on the basketball court in his homeland, where he is among the country's most beloved sportsmen. He was set to play at the Olympics this summer before the coronavirus pandemic forced the postponement of the event until the summer of 2021.</p>

                 <p class="ti">Scola played at his fifth FIBA Basketball World Cup last year in China and made the All-Star Five</p>
                 <p class="pa2">"You would have to shoot Scola in the head for him not to play in the Olympics," Ginobili said to Argentina television station TN. "Especially after everything that he has done for the team to qualify."

                    The power forward made the All-Star Five while leading Argentina to the FIBA Basketball World Cup Final 2019 in China and qualification for Tokyo. 
                    
                    "He deserves to end playing with a jersey that gave him so much joy and to which he gave so much joy," Ginobili said.
                    
                    Ginobili and Scola were Argentina teammates and reached the podium at various events, including at the 2004 Olympics when El Alma captured the gold medal.
                    
                    The last time the two played together was four years ago at the Rio de Janeiro Games. Ginobili and another long-time Argentina star, Andres Nocioni, retired from the national team after those Summer Games.</p>

                    <p class="ti">Scola, Ginobili and their teammates celebrated Argentina's Olympic Gold Medal triumph in Athens</p>
                    <p class="pa2">One of those is in Italy, with Pallacanestro Varese, a club coached by Attilio Caja.

                        Caja said to Varesenews.it: "We would be delighted to have a player like him in the team. He would be ideal to guide the young group and not only on the court, but off of it. His arrival would give prestige to the club."
                        
                        Whatever unfolds, whether Scola plays or does not play, he has said he has no unfinished business. Once his career is over, he'll be be content.
                        
                        "I am at peace with myself," he said. "Whatever I have had to do in a career of 25 years, I've already done."</p>
